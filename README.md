## Where are you from

I come from Jamshedpur, also know as the steel city of India. Located in the high mineral ore rich state of Jharkhand, the steel city got its name from the first iron and steel company of India "Tata Iron and steel company(TISCO)" established in 1907.

## IT Interest

I did my undergrad in civil engineering and worked as a Junior engineer for 10 months and moved to GIS and worked for 1.5 years. Then I moved to Data analytics as I liked working with raw data and turning it into a valuable information. I have also worked with clients to move from legacy based servers to Cloud and have worked in GCP. Now I am interested in Generative AI and its ethical implementation.

## First Computing Device

My first computing device was an assembled desk computer with an AMD chip. Sadly I do not remember which AMD model it was.
